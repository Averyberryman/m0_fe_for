# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

- This is by far my shakiest concept yet. I am having trouble understanding how [i] interacts with array methods and how it can modify variables.

2. This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

- I definitely got frustrated applying other background knowledge because the language and shorthand seems to change for some equations over others based on preference. I definitely feel that my time in between mod0 and mod1 is going to be spent studfying mostly this section and how to wrap my head around it.

3.What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

- I need to practice for statements exhaustively so that I can understand how to manipulate [i] and when to use brackets, where to put it to modify something, etc. I also need to get better at researching methods, for example isolating lowercase letters, etc. I had a really tough time with the practice problems.

4. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

- I Think I need to practice these concepts live with an instructor to identify where I'm getting confused. I had a really easy time until a certain point, where I think I may have thought I grasped something and then applied that misunderstanding to the rest of the lesson, so I had to go back and unlearn what I thought I knew and start from scratch.
